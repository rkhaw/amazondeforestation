## Investigation into the correlation between albedo and deforestation within the Amazon

Deforestation, primarily driven by agriculture, forestry, mining, and wildfires, poses a significant threat to tropical forests globally. The loss of vegetation leads to a warmer climate and influences land albedo, further changing climate dynamics. By investigating changes in vegetation cover along with climatic variables (evapotranspiration, temperature, rainfall, and albedo) from 2000 to 2022, this study aimed to interpret the relationship between deforestation driven by land use and the local climate in the Brazilian Amazon.

We focused on two main questions:
1.     How does deforestation affect the local climate in the Amazon rainforest?
2.     How does deforestation affect land albedo in the Amazon rainforest?
